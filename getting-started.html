<p>Hello new Bonsai developer!</p>

<p>There are some things you might want to know before you get started. In this section, we&rsquo;re going to walk you through the Bonsai Platform components and some of the fundamental ideas of the Bonsai Platform that are frequently asked questions. Next, we&rsquo;ll guide you through installing the necessary tools, connecting a simulator, training your BRAIN, and finally using your BRAIN!</p>

<p>At the end of this guide we&rsquo;ll link you to resources that give you the tools to keep going, like our <a href="inkling-guide.html">Inkling Guide</a> and <a href="cli-reference.html">CLI Reference</a>. You can also check out our <a href="examples.html">examples</a> and tutorials (coming soon!).</p>

<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re not interested in the background, and want to jump right into the action, you can skip down to our <a href="#install-prerequisites">Install Prerequisites</a> section.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-components-of-the-bonsai-platform">What are the components of the Bonsai Platform?</h2>

<p>This image displays all the components of Bonsai&rsquo;s Platform. The Platform enables developers to more efficiently build, teach and use intelligence models. A training source is any source of data used to teach or train an AI. It includes batch data like a large spreadsheet or a set of labels and images and synthetic data like the output from a simulation.</p>

<p><img src="images/bonsai_infographic_1024.png" alt="The Bonsai Platform" /></p>

<h6 id="build">Build</h6>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bonsai Command Line Interface (CLI):</strong> is a command line tool that enables you to configure and control the Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://beta.bons.ai">beta.bons.ai</a>:</strong> The address for Bonsai&rsquo;s beta web interface; this is the browser based tool that includes your <em>BRAIN Dashboard</em> and <em>BRAIN Details</em> page.</li>
<li><strong>Simulators:</strong> are currently the only training source implemented. Simulators are often a complex, interactive virtual environment. They usually have state, which is a representation of the world inside the virtual environment.</li>
<li><strong>Generators:</strong> are a training source. They produce labeled data programmatically. This data is effectively infinite. A generator could, for example, produce a random (but known) integer, set of line segments, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> is also a training source. It is information related to the scenario being trained and can also be used to test and evaluate how well the training is implemented. Data could be a collection of images and labels or the rows of a spreadsheet. An example of a data set you could train with is the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST database</a>, which is a collection of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems and other machine learning systems.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">
Currently, during our private beta, you can only use simulators as your training source.
</aside> 

<h6 id="teach">Teach</h6>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inkling:</strong> our unique, special purpose, pedagogical programming language. Pedagogical programming is a new programming paradigm. It expresses the solution to a problem in terms of how you teach the computer to find the solution as opposed to how to calculate the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine:</strong> abstracts away and automates the low-level mechanics of artificial intelligence. Each Inkling program developed is fed into the Bonsai AI Engine in order to generate and train appropriate models (referred to as BRAINs).</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="use">Use</h6>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mastermind:</strong> the Bonsai AI application for building AI. This tool will contain our Integrated Development Environment (IDE). <strong>Note:</strong> This tool will not be available for the private beta.</li>
<li><strong>SDK &amp; Libraries:</strong> enables you to connect your own simulators to the Bonsai AI Engine. They also enable you to integrate your application with your BRAIN.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP API:</strong> enables AI creators and AI users to interact with the Bonsai AI Engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>After your BRAIN is created and trained, you can use it with your application by connecting it to the API generated by the AI Engine using the Bonsai library specific to your application&rsquo;s programming language. Ultimately, our platform enables you to build AI agents that work (or play) for you without a deep knowledge of machine learning.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-brain-what-is-the-bonsai-ai-engine">What is a BRAIN? What is the Bonsai AI Engine?</h2>

<p>A BRAIN, <strong>Basic Recurrent Artificial Intelligence Network</strong>, is an individual AI agent, and it is programmed to learn using Inkling. Each BRAIN lives in the <strong>Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine</strong> which manages and automates much of the lower level complexities of working with artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The Bonsai AI Engine contains a vast array of machine learning algorithms, manages data streaming and data storage, and provides the efficient allocation of hardware resources. It is built with an infrastructure that supports streaming data efficiently through the system, and it uses a set of heuristics to make choices about which learning algorithms to use to train each BRAIN. The set of heuristics also make it possible for it to choose from any number of possible algorithms, topologies, etc., train all of them in parallel, and pick the best result.</p>

<p>For example, if the BRAIN Server picked Deep Q-Learning, which is a machine learning algorithm, then the system also picks the appropriate topology, hyper-parameters, and initial weight values.</p>

<p>The Bonsai AI Engine also determines when to train each concept, how much (or little) to train each concept based on its relevance, and, ultimately, produces a trained BRAIN. Furthermore, it does something we call <strong>meta-learning</strong>. Meta-learning means that the system keeps a kind of memory or record about each program it&rsquo;s seen, the data it used for training, and the generated AIs that it&rsquo;s made. It also records how fast those AIs trained and how accurate they became. The BRAIN server is continuously learning and improving over that dataset.</p>

<h3 id="you-might-say-the-system-learns-to-make-learning-systems">You might say the system learns to make learning systems.</h3>

<h2 id="what-is-a-simulator">What is a simulator?</h2>

<p>A simulator imitates a real-world situation in a virtual environment, which enables a user to model and test situations that would often, otherwise be very complicated to set up and test. Your simulator could be a game, such as breakout, or an emulation of a real-world process, such as a self-driving car. Training with simulators is especially useful for optimization, or for use with complex control problems that can be modeled in a simulator.</p>

<p>Training means teaching a BRAIN to reach a specific outcome in the simulator. The training involves using a specific set of concepts, a curriculum, and lessons, which are described in the Inkling file.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>  Currently, a simulation runs on your local machine and streams data to the BRAIN server for training. This means your computer needs to remain connected to the Bonsai AI Engine while your BRAIN is training. If your computer is disconnected from the server you can reconnect within an hour and it will pick back up where it left off. Otherwise, your training will start on a new version (your old training is still saved to the previous version). If you want to leave your training running overnight, please make sure that your computer will stay connected by turning off sleep functionality. </p>

<p>Today, we only support simulators written in python. To learn more about connecting your own simulator, refer to our SDK Reference (Coming soon!).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-inkling">What is Inkling?</h2>

<p><strong>Inkling</strong> is our programming language designed to express higher level abstractions related to teaching.</p>

<p>Inkling enables us to use a teaching-oriented approach, also known as Pedagogical Programming, for training AI. It provides a set of foundational primitives that can be used to represent AI without specifying how the AI is created. By abstracting away the underlying algorithms and techniques, you can focus on creative ways to describe your problems and leave the heavy lifting to us.</p>

<p>This means that you, the developer, can leverage your domain-specific expertise about the problem space and leverage our expertise about machine learning.</p>

<p>Inkling is designed to enable you to solve any AI problem whether learning to label images or controlling a simulation. In the current version, Bonsai&rsquo;s technology is focused on solving control and optimization problems using simulation. When you train a BRAIN to solve an AI problem, you write a file in Inkling that teaches the AI to solve it. Inkling files describe the concepts that you want to teach and the curriculum and lessons for teaching them.</p>

<p>To learn more about Inkling, refer to our <a href="inkling-guide.html">Inkling Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-bonsai-cli">What is the Bonsai CLI?</h2>

<p>The Bonsai Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool that enables you to configure the Bonsai AI Engine. The CLI is especially useful for automation and connection to other tools. Currently, there are some actions that can only be performed using the CLI, such as loading your Inkling file and connecting your simulator.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Bonsai CLI, refer to our <a href="cli-reference.html">CLI Reference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-beta-bons-ai-for">What is <a href="https://beta.bons.ai">beta.bons.ai</a> for?</h2>

<p>The Bonsai Beta Website is a browser-based tool for configuring and analyzing BRAINs stored in the Bonsai AI Engine. In the future, this website will be useful for sharing BRAINs, collaborating, and learning. There is some information you can only get from beta.bons.ai, such as a visualization of a BRAIN&rsquo;s training progress.</p>

<h3 id="brain-dashboard"><strong>BRAIN Dashboard</strong></h3>

<p>Your BRAIN Dashboard contains all of your BRAINs. The BRAIN Dashboard is also where you can create new BRAINs.</p>

<h3 id="brain-details"><strong>BRAIN Details</strong></h3>

<p>There is a BRAIN Details page for each of your BRAINs. Each page shows that BRAIN&rsquo;s status, training graph, and commands you can use in the CLI specifically for this BRAIN.</p>

<h1 id="create-your-brain">Create your BRAIN</h1>

<p>Create your BRAIN and give it a name. You can also create a BRAIN from your <a href="https://beta.bons.ai">beta.bons.ai</a> BRAIN Dashboard instead of using the command line. Either way, you will view your BRAIN&rsquo;s progress on the BRAIN Details page.</p>

<h3 id="create-from-web">Create from Web</h3>

<p><img src="images/no_brains_image.png" alt="BRAINS Dashboard Page" /></p>

<p>The dashboard has a NEW BRAIN button, pictured above. Click on it to start the BRAIN creation process, where you&rsquo;re provided a form to give your brain a name and description. Name can contain alpha, numerals, or hyphens; the description is arbitrary and should contain human-readable text that explains your intent for the BRAIN.</p>

<h3 id="create-from-command-line">Create from Command Line</h3>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bonsai create myMountainCarBrain
</code></pre>
<p>You may give your brain a name with <code class="prettyprint">bonsai create brainName</code> but there is no option for a description with this method but after you create your BRAIN, you can change its description from the web on the BRAIN Details page.</p>

<h1 id="train-your-brain">Train your BRAIN</h1>

<h2 id="load-sample-inkling-into-your-brain">Load sample Inkling into your BRAIN</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bonsai load
</code></pre>
<p>Load your sample Inkling file for the Mountain Car simulation.</p>

<h2 id="start-training-mode">Start Training Mode</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bonsai train start
</code></pre>
<p>Almost there! Time to tell the AI engine to prepare a new BRAIN version for training. Start the training mode for your BRAIN.</p>

<h2 id="connect-the-simulator-for-training">Connect the simulator for training</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Python 2</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>python mountaincar_simulator.py --train-brain=myMountainCarBrain --headless
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight powershell"><code><span class="c1"># same as above</span>
</code></pre><pre class="highlight shell"><code>python3 mountaincar_simulator.py --train-brain<span class="o">=</span>myMountainCarBrain --headless
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is in place, it&rsquo;s time to start the simulator and test things out. To do this, call Python and then the simulator file. Training will begin automatically and if the simulator gets disconnected, training resumes from the same point when the simulator is reconnected if it&rsquo;s within an hour of the disconnect. Remember, as mentioned in <a href="#what-is-a-simulator">What is a simulator?</a> if you want your training to take place overnight, make sure that your computer won&rsquo;t go to sleep and disconnect for more than an hour or that training time will be lost!</p>

<aside class="notice">
We use headless here to indicate we don&rsquo;t need to see a graphical display from the simulator; if you&rsquo;d like to see it and watch the simulator learn, omit this option.
</aside>

<h2 id="view-your-brain-training-status">View your BRAIN training status</h2>

<p>View your BRAIN&rsquo;s training status as it trains on the simulator by going to the BRAIN&rsquo;s Dashboard page on <a href="https://beta.bons.ai">beta.bons.ai</a>. Training Mountain Car takes about an hour to get sufficient training to beat the game most of the time. If you want flawless victories each time the simulator can take up to 2 hours before you&rsquo;ll see the graph level out.</p>

<p><img src="images/fully_trained_brain.png" alt="Fully Trained BRAIN" /></p>

<p>There is no automatic ending to training, you can train forever, but there will be diminishing returns after a couple of hours. You can play around with training for 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour, etc and use your BRAIN to see how well it plays each time! It takes about 700 episodes to train the BRAIN correctly. Our ideal target is an average reward of -195 or higher over 100 consecutive episodes.</p>

<h2 id="stop-training">Stop training</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bonsai train stop
</code></pre>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve gotten to this level of performance (or sooner if you prefer), CTRL-C to disconnect the simulator, then <code class="prettyprint">bonsai train stop</code> will end the training, and proceed to prediction.</p>

<h1 id="use-your-brain">Use your BRAIN</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Python 2</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>python mountaincar_simulator.py --predict-brain=myMountainCarBrain --predict-version=latest
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight powershell"><code><span class="c1"># same as above</span>
</code></pre><pre class="highlight shell"><code>python3 mountaincar_simulator.py --predict-brain<span class="o">=</span>myMountainCarBrain --predict-version<span class="o">=</span>latest
</code></pre>
<p>After your BRAIN is finished training it can play the Mountain Car game. How well it does depends on how long you let it train! Using your BRAIN involves calling Python on the same simulator file, but now in predict mode, and <code class="prettyprint">--predict-version=latest</code> will use the latest training session that you just ran.</p>
