# CLI Reference

The Bonsai Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text based tool that enables you to configure and control the Bonsai Artificial Intelligence Engine. The CLI is especially useful for automation and connection to other tools. Currently, there are some actions that can only be performed using the CLI, such as loading your Inkling file and connecting your simulator.  

```shell
$ bonsai command --help
```

Use `bonsai command --help` to get information about a specific command. You can use bonsai --help to view a list of groups and commands.

The Bonsai CLI is hierarchical.

## Configure Command

```
$ bonsai configure
```

**configure** sets up authentication between you, as a user, and the server. This enables the server to verify that you are allowed to write Inkling code to a specific BRAIN. You can find your access code in your account settings at .

## Brain Commands

###### Create

```
$ bonsai create brainName
```

**create** generates a new brain and names it (brainName).  It also
sets the assumed brain name for later commands.

Brain names can include:

* letters
* numbers
* dashes

It is case insensitive, but case aware.

###### Load

```
$ bonsai load
```

**load** loads an Inkling file into the current brain.  The project
file in the current directory (`bonsai_brain.bproj`) determines which
inkling file to load.  You can specify --brain brainName, or --project
/brain/project to use another brain.

## Train group commands

###### Start

```
$ bonsai train start
```

**start** turns on/enables training mode for the current BRAIN. The BRAIN trains whenever the simulator is connected. If the simulator is disconnected, the BRAIN remains in training mode, and it will train again where it left off when the simulator is reconnected.

###### Stop

```
$ bonsai train stop
```

**stop** turns off training mode for the current BRAIN.
