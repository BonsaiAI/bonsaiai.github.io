The Bonsai Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based tool that enables you to configure and control the Bonsai Artificial Intelligence Engine. The CLI is especially useful for automation and connection to other tools. Currently, there are some actions that can only be performed using the CLI, such as loading your Inkling file and connecting your simulator.

This guide will walk you through how to install the Bonsai CLI, setup your first project, and get a simulator running, all from your local computer. If you haven't yet, it will be helpful to read the [Quick Start Overview][2] to give context to the commands you'll be running in this guide.

The reference document for all of the commands you will see in this guide can be found in the [CLI Reference][1].
