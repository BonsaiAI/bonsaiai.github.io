Use `bonsai COMMAND --help` to get information about a specific command. You can use `bonsai --help` to view a list of options for COMMAND.

## bonsai configure

```
$ bonsai configure --help
Usage: bonsai configure [OPTIONS]

  Authenticate with the BRAIN Server.

Options:
  --key TEXT  Provide an access key.
  --help      Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai configure` sets up authentication between you (as a user) and the server. This enables the server to verify that you are allowed to write Inkling code to a specific BRAIN.

You can find your access key at [https://beta.bons.ai/accounts/key](https://beta.bons.ai/accounts/key).

## bonsai create

```
$ bonsai create --help
Usage: bonsai create [OPTIONS] BRAIN_NAME

  Creates a BRAIN and sets the default BRAIN for future commands.

Options:
  --project TEXT       Override to target another project directory.
  --project-type TEXT  Specify to download and use demo/starter project files.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai create` generates a new brain and names it BRAIN_NAME.  It also sets the assumed BRAIN name for later commands.

BRAIN names may include:

* letters
* numbers
* dashes

It is case insensitive, but case aware.

## bonsai download

```
$ bonsai download --help
Usage: bonsai.py download [OPTIONS] BRAIN_NAME

  Downloads all the files related to a BRAIN.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai download` creates local copies of your BRAIN project files. This will contain your Inkling code and may also contain simulator code. This command works like git clone - it copies files into a new directory, and will not try and overwrite files that already exist.


## bonsai list

```
$ bonsai list --help
Usage: bonsai list [OPTIONS]

  Lists BRAINs owned by current user or by the user under a given URL.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai list` shows you the BRAINs you currently own or by a user under a given URL. You must have your Bonsai account configured with `bonsai configure` before you can see this list.

## bonsai load

```
$ bonsai load --help
Usage: bonsai.py load [OPTIONS]

  Loads an inkling file into the given BRAIN.

Options:
  --brain TEXT    Override to target another BRAIN.
  --project TEXT  Override to target another project directory.
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai load` loads an Inkling file into the current brain.  The project file in the current directory (`bonsai_brain.bproj`) determines which inkling file to load.  You can specify `--brain BRAIN_NAME`, or `--project /brain/project` to use another brain.

## bonsai log

```
$ bonsai log --help
Usage: bonsai log [OPTIONS]

  Displays last 1000 lines of the running simulator's output.

Options:
  --brain TEXT    Override to target another BRAIN.
  --project TEXT  Override to target another project directory.
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

Displays *stderr* and *stdout* from the currently running simulator. This will display the last 1000 lines of the running simulator's output. You can override the BRAIN you want to log if multiple are running at the same time or the project .

## bonsai push

```
$ bonsai push --help
Usage: bonsai push [OPTIONS]

  Uploads project file(s) to a BRAIN.

Options:
  --brain TEXT    Override to target another BRAIN.
  --project TEXT  Override to target another project directory
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai push` will upload the entire project file contents and all accompanying files to the Bonsai AI Engine and can be viewed on [beta.bons.ai](beta.bons.ai). You can override the BRAIN you want to push to or the project directory you want to push.

This command replaces the need for `bonsai load` which is now depricated and will be removed in a future release. 

## bonsai train

```
$ bonsai train --help
Usage: bonsai train [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Start and stop training on a BRAIN, as well as get training status information.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  start   Trains the specified BRAIN.
  status  Gets training status on the specified BRAIN.
  stop    Stops training on the specified BRAIN.
```

`bonsai train` has no funtionality itself. It will output the help to guide you to start, status, or stop training.

## bonsai train start

```
$ bonsai train start --help

  Trains the specified BRAIN.

Options:
  --brain TEXT    Override to target another BRAIN.
  --project TEXT  Override to target another project directory.
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

`bonsai start` turns on/enables training mode for the current BRAIN. The BRAIN trains whenever the simulator is connected. If the simulator is disconnected, the BRAIN remains in training mode, and it will train again where it left off when the simulator is reconnected.

## bonsai train stop

```
$ bonsai train stop --help
Usage: bonsai train stop [OPTIONS] BRAIN_NAME

  Stops training on the specified BRAIN.

```

`bonsai train status` is used to see the current training status of your BRAIN.

## bonsai sims list

```
$ bonsai sims list --help
