# Event Class

Abstract base class for encapsulating Simulator state. Event types correspond to different
procedures in client code (see `enum class Type`).

### enum class Type

```cpp
auto event = get_next_event();
if (event->type() == Type::Episode_Start) {
    auto es_E = dynamic_pointer_cast<EpisodeStartEvent>(event);
    auto initial_properties = es_E->initial_properties;
    auto initial_state = es_E->initial_state;
    // process initial properties/state
} else if (event->type() == Type::Simulate) {
    auto sim_E = dynamic_pointer_cast<SimulatorEvent>(event);
    auto prediction = sim_E->prediction;
    auto state = sim_E->state;
    auto reward = sim_E->reward;
    auto terminal = sim_E->terminal;
    // process simulator step 
} else if (event->type() == Type::Finished) {
    close();
}
```

| Value          | Description |
| ----           | ----        |
| `Episode_Start`|  Reset the simulator and set initial state. |
| `Simulate`     |  Advance the simulation with the next prediction and record resulting state. |
| `Finished`     |  Simulation complete. BRAIN does not expect further state data. |
| `Unknown`      |  No event corresponding to last message exchange. |

### Type type()
Returns the Type of the Event. Implemented for each specialization of Event.

## EpisodeStartEvent Class
Signals a boundary between training episodes. Requires resetting the simulation environment
and returning its initial state to the **BRAIN**.

###### std::shared_ptr<const InklingMessage> initial_properties
Settings used when resetting the simulation environment.

###### std::shared_ptr<InklingMessage> initial_state
Directly manipulate to reflect the state resulting from sim environment reset.

See `InklingMessage` API for detail.

## SimulateEvent Class
Signals that the **BRAIN** is ready to receive the simulator state resulting from
the next prediction in the queue.

###### std::shared_ptr<const InklingMessage> prediction
The prediction (action) intended for the next simulation step.

###### std::shared_ptr<InklingMessage> state
Directly manipulate to reflect the state resulting from applying `prediction`
to the simulation environment.

See `InklingMessage` API for detail.

###### std::shared_ptr<float> reward
Directly manipulate to reflect the reward corresponding to `state`.

###### std::shared_ptr<bool> terminal
Directly manipulate to reflect whether the current `state` is terminal.

## FinishedEvent Class
Signals that the **BRAIN** is done training. No more simulation steps are expected.

## UnknownEvent Class
Signals that no action is required.
