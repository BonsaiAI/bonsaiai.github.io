# Examples Overview

This page contains working examples of Inkling code in conjunction with python simulator files. All of these examples and the libraries that acompany them can be found on [BonsaiAI's GitHub page][1] and are also linked within each Example.

If you have any suggestions of examples you'd like to see us impliment please [contact the support team][2].

### Basic Walkthrough Examples
* **Basic Simulator**: A project called *Find the Center* which walks you through how to create a simple Inkling file that connects to a basic python simulator.

### OpenAI Gym Examples
* **Cart Pole**: A simple control problem where a cart must make a simple move to keep a pole balanced on top.
* **Mountain Car**: A simple control problem where a car must build up enough momentum to climb a hill.

### Real World Examples
* **HVAC with EnergyPlus**: An example of climate control machine teaching using EnergyPlus and BCVTB for simulation.
