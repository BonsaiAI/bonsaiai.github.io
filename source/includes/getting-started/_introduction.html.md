# Introduction

[//]: # (If any commented statements become false, change prior text)

This guide starts you on the path of unlocking the world of machine learning and AI.

Let's first go through some of the major concepts you'll want to know before you get started writing **Inkling** files, connecting **simulators**, and training **BRAIN**s. Then, we'll walk you through the steps to:

* install the Bonsai CLI (one-time task)
* create your first BRAIN
* load an Inkling file and connect a simulator
* train your BRAIN
* use your BRAIN

Then, we'll follow all of that up with our other resources that give you the tools to keep going, like our [Inkling Guide][2] and [CLI Reference][3]. You can also check out our [examples][4] and tutorials (coming soon!).

[//]: # (You can only link to one specific example, there are no tutorials)

If you're not interested in the background, and want to jump right into the action, you can skip down to our [Let's Get Started][1] section.
