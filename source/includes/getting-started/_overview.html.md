# Overview

Hello new Bonsai developer!

There are some things you might want to know before you get started. In this section, we're going
to walk you through the components and fundamental ideas of The Bonsai
Platform. Read through the Quick Start guide to learn how to get set up with The Bonsai Platform and what you can do with it.

If you're the type of developer who wants to dive right in and see The Bonsai Platform working,
however, **skip down to [Create Your BRAIN][1]** below. We'll guide you through setting up your
first BRAIN with the Cartpole template, how to get that BRAIN training, and then explain what
to do with it!

If you'd prefer not to use our web interface, instead you can [Use the CLI for Training][7] for a similar guide
to this one on your local computer or virtual machine.

### Build

* **Bonsai Command Line Interface (CLI):** is a command line tool that enables you to configure and
control The Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine. This is an alternative to using the Web
Interface and is not covered in this guide. See how to [Use the CLI for Training][7] if you prefer CLI development.
* **Web Interface:** is the browser-based tool found at [beta.bons.ai][3] for creating and analyzing
BRAINs stored in The Bonsai AI Engine. You can also visualize the BRAIN's training on this page.
This is what we will use for this Quick Start guide because you can get up and running on the
Bonsai Platform in just a few clicks!
* **Simulators:** are often a complex interactive virtual environment. For this project, you'll
be using a simple simulator from OpenAI. Simulators usually have state, which is a representation of the
world inside the virtual environment and receive actions which change that state.

<aside class="notice">
Currently, during The Bonsai Platform preview, you can only use simulators as your training source. Generators
and Data sources will be released at a future time.

### Teach

* **Inkling:** our special purpose programming language for machine teaching. It expresses the
solution to a problem in terms of how you teach the computer to find the solution as opposed to
how to calculate the solution. This means that you, the developer, can leverage your domain-specific
expertise about the problem space and leverage our expertise about machine learning. To learn more
about Inkling, refer to our [Inkling Guide][8].
* **Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine:** abstracts away and automates the low-level
mechanics of artificial intelligence. Each Inkling program developed is fed into the Bonsai AI
Engine in order to generate and train appropriate models (referred to as [BRAINs][5]).

### Use

* **SDK/Library:** can be used after your BRAIN is created and trained. Use with your own
application by connecting it to the API generated by the AI Engine using the [Bonsai library][4]. 

Ultimately, our platform enables you to build AI agents that work (or play) for you without a deep
knowledge of machine learning.

## What are BRAINs?

A BRAIN, **Basic Recurrent Artificial Intelligence Network**, is an individual AI agent, and it is
programmed to learn using Inkling. Each BRAIN lives in the **Bonsai Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Engine** which manages and automates much of the lower level complexities of working with artificial intelligence.

The Bonsai AI Engine contains a vast array of machine learning algorithms, manages data streaming
and data storage, and provides the efficient allocation of hardware resources. It is built with an
infrastructure that supports streaming data efficiently through the system, and it uses a set of
heuristics to make choices about which learning algorithms to use to train each BRAIN. The set of
heuristics also make it possible for it to choose from any number of possible algorithms, topologies,
etc., train all of them in parallel, and pick the best result.

For example, if the BRAIN Server picked Deep Q-Learning, which is a machine learning algorithm,
then the system also picks the appropriate topology, hyper-parameters, and initial weight values.

Read more about how the Bonsai AI Engine works in our [AI Engine Guide][6].

## What is a simulator?

> ![Brain and Simulator][10]

A simulator is software that simulates an imperative model of a process, transitioning from state
to state as actions are applied. Robotics, industrial automation, supply chain logistics, and
structural engineering are all domains which use simulators to model the behavior of complex systems.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can work with simulated models to train a BRAIN to perform tasks within
the modeled system. Tasks can be as simple as "stand this pole upright" or as complex as "learn to walk." 

To be effective, a BRAIN needs to be trained using DRL against a simulated model. The Bonsai SDK
allows the DRL system to control your simulator during the training process. Any simulator which has
an initial state, and can be incremented through time, can be connected to the Bonsai training system.

Training means teaching a BRAIN to reach a specific outcome in the simulation. The training involves
using a specific set of concepts, a curriculum, and lessons, which are described in the Inkling file.

Today, we only support simulators written in Python or C++. To learn more about connecting your own
simulator, refer to our [Library Reference][4].
