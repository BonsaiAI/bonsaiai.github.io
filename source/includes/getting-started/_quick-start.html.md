# Create Your BRAIN

Before you begin, you will need to have access to our private beta. If you don't have access yet, request access at [bons.ai][1].

For this quick start guide, we'll be walking you through how to create a BRAIN to train the [OpenAI Gym][4] environment for Cartpole, a simple balance control problem. The walkthrough of the Inkling code and simulator interface can be found in our [Examples][2] and the full source code for you to take a look at is on [Bonsai's GitHub][3].

### BRAINS Dashboard Page

> ![No BRAINs Dashboard][5]

The dashboard has a NEW BRAIN button, pictured above. Click on it to start the BRAIN creation process, where youâ€™re provided a form to give your brain a name and description.

Then select "cartpole" from the list of template BRAINs. This is one of the simulations that can be managed on Bonsai's servers, so you don't need to run anything locally on your computer to train this simulation.

Click on the "Create" button which will take you to the BRAIN's Details page.
