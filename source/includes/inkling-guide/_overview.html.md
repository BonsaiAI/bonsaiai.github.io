Welcome to Inkling, Bonsai AI's special purpose programming language for training AI.

Inkling is a declarative, strongly typed programming language specifically designed for artificial intelligence (AI). It abstracts away the vast world of dynamic AI algorithms that require expertise in machine learning and enables more developers to program AI. An Inkling file contains the concepts -- what you want to teach the AI -- and the curriculum, -- how you want to teach the concepts -- necessary to train your BRAIN. Before you read through this section about the Inkling language, you should familiarize yourself with the various components of the Bonsai Artificial Intelligence Engine, which you can read about in our [Getting Started Guide][1].

If you're interesting in finding out more about what's going on under the hood of the AI engine, check out the [AI Engine Guide][2].
