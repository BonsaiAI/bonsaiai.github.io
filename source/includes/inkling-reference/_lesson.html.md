# Lesson

Reference for the keyword **lesson**. Also, describes the keywords: **follows**, **configure**, **constrain**, **until**, **minimize**, **maximize**, **configure**, **with**, and **end.**

### What is it?

The **lesson** (keyword) declares an individual lesson for the concept being trained by the curriculum.  Lessons are contained within curriculum statements. A curriculum can contain multiple lessons.

### Why do I use it?

Lessons give you control over the training of the mental model. They allow you to break down the training of the concept into phases where each phase is implemented by a lesson.

### How do I use it?

```inkling--syntax
lesson lessonName
    follows prevLessonName
  configureClause
  trainClause
  testClause
  untilClause
```

Select the Syntax tab to show the clauses a lesson can contain.

Lessons allow the machine to learn the concept in stages rather than all at
once. 

Here are the overall lesson rules:

* Lesson statements appear within curriculum statements.
* Lesson statements may contain the following keywords: **configure**, **train**, **test**, and **until**.
* Lessons appear after the objective clause in curriculums.
* Lessons can be ordered, using the **follows** clause. Note that this ordering is a suggestion to the instructor, not a hard and fast rule.

Lessons have **configure**, **test**, **train**, and **until** clauses. 
Some lesson clauses have defaults so if a clause is not specified the default
will be in effect. Also in certain circumstances not all clauses are available.
See the lesson clauses table in this chapter for the rules which apply to a specific
clause.

### Breakout Example

```inkling--code
schema BreakoutConfig   # configured in lesson configureClause
  UInt32 level,
  UInt8{1:4} paddle_width,
  Float32 bricks_percent
end

curriculum ball_location_curriculum
  train ball_location
  with simulator breakout_simulator
  objective ball_location_distance

    lesson constant_breakout
      configure           # configure to constant values
        constrain bricks_percent with Float32{0.5},
        constrain level with UInt32{1},    # e.g. level = 1
        constrain paddle_width with UInt8{4}
      train
        from frame in breakout_simulator
        select frame
        send frame
      test
        from frame in breakout_simulator
        select frame
        send frame
      until
        minimize ball_location_distance

    lesson vary_breakout follows constant_breakout
      configure          # configure to type constraints
      constrain bricks_percent with Float32{0.1:0.01:1.0},
      constrain level with UInt32{1:100}, # e.g. level varies from 1..100
      constrain paddle_width with UInt8{1:4}
    train
      from frame in breakout_simulator
      select frame
      send frame
    test
      from frame in breakout_simulator
      select frame
      send frame
    until
      minimize ball_location_distance
end
```

In this example we show lessons that break into stages the task of  playing
the game breakout. The first lesson, `constant_breakout`, trains the machine
with a set of fixed values as configuration parameters. The second lesson,
`vary_breakout`, which **follows** `constant_breakout`, trains the machine with a set of configuration parameters that vary according to specified type constraints.

The two lessons in our example, `constant_breakout` and `vary_breakout`, are different in their configure clause. The first sets the fields in the configuration schema to constant values and the second lesson, `vary_breakout`, generates sets of values constrained by the type constraint. 

Note that the **constrain** name in our example specifies a field in the
configuration schema for the simulator. These fields are `bricks_percent`,
`level`, and `paddle_width`. When such fields are initialized with values from a
type constraint they are often called **placeholders**.  This means that the name is is not the name of a specific value but rather it is the name of a range of values which will be input during training.

You can find more discussion of type constraint rules in the [schema][1] section. (Schema declarations can also use type constraints.)

## Lesson Clause Table

Lesson clauses have defaults so if a clause is not specified the default will be assumed. Also in certain circumstances not all clauses are available. This table specifies the rules. Recall that the _trainingSpecifier_ appears after the keyword **with** in the curriculum.

**Table for Lesson Clauses**

        training specifier       |     configure clause           |        train clause        |       test clause         |      until clause          
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- 
**data**      | Not allowed. | Must have train or test at a minimum. Defaults to none.| Must have train or test at a mininum. Defaults to none. | Not user specified. Will default to: *minimize objectiveName*.
**generator** | Required.    | If neither train nor test is present, defaults to: *from item in generator select item send item.image expects item.label*. | If neither train nor test is present, defaults to: *from item in generator select item send item.image expect item.label*. If not present, generate default for every lesson. | Not user specified. Will default to: *minimize objectiveName*.
**simulator** | Required.    | If neither train nor test is present, defaults to: *item in simulator select item send item*. | If neither train nor test is present, defaults to: *from item in simulator select item*. If not present, generate default for every lesson. | Required.

###### Lesson Clause Rules

* To summarize the table above, for a lesson associated with a _trainingSpecifier_ of **data**: one or both of the lesson clauses **train** and **test** are required (and there are no default versions of these clauses).
* Test clause is optional for any particular lesson. However if the last lesson has no test clause it is an error.
* The **follows** clause on the lesson is optional. **Note:** If there is no **follows** clause and the lessons are executed in parallel, training will be slower.
* To summarize the table above: for a lesson associated with a _trainingSpecifier_ of **generator** or **simulator**:
    - if neither the **test** or **train** lesson clauses are present, defaults for both clauses are generated. (See the above table for default details.) Otherwise, no defaults are generated.

## Lesson Syntax

```inkling--syntax
lessonStatement ::=
  lesson <lessonName>
    [follows <lessonName>]?
    configureClause?
    trainClause?
    untilClause?
    testClause?
```

Select the Syntax tab to see the lesson syntax. The syntax for lesson and its subordinate
clauses is displayed.

###### Lesson Configure Clause Syntax

```inkling--syntax
configureClause ::=
configure
  [constrain <configSchemaFieldName> with constrainedType]+
```

Select the Syntax tab for the syntax for this clause.

###### Lesson Train/Test Clause Syntax

```inkling--syntax
trainClause ::=
train
  fromClause
  send <name>
  [expect <name>]?    # only valid for data or generator
trainingSpecifer
```

```inkling--syntax
testClause ::=
test
  fromClause
  send <name>
  [expect <name>]?    # only valid for data or generator
trainingSpecifer
```

Select the Syntax tab for the syntax for these clauses.

The **test** clause and the **train** clause have identical syntax except for
their keyword (**train** or **test**).  However they both vary depending on the
_trainingSpecifier_ in the curriculum. Note that the **expect** is only available in those cases that have known expected values, and that occurs when the _trainingSpecifier_ is **data** or **generator**.

The **from** clause in the test/train syntax is used to name and describe the
training data that is sent by the system (either from a labeled data set, in the
**data** case, or by the generator or simulator) to the lesson. The next example
shows the usage of the **from** clause.
‍

### Segments Example

```inkling--code
‍generator segments_generator(UInt8 segmentCount)
  yield (segments_training_schema)     # training will yield data with this schema
end

schema segments_training_schema
  UInt8{0:10} num_segments,
  Luminance(28, 28) image
end

curriculum segments_curriculum
  train Segments
  with generator segments_generator
  objective segments_objective
    lesson segments
      configure
        constrain segmentCount with UInt8{0:10}
    train
      from item in segments_generator # segments_generator's yield clause
        select item                 # specifies the appropriate schema.
        send item.image             # A field in segments_training_schema
        expect item.num_segments    # A field in segments_training_schema
end
```

Select the Inkling tab to show an example of the **from** clause in a
curricululm which trains the machine to recognize line segments in an image. The
generator `segments_generator` sends an image and expects `num_segments` in
return. (The returned `num_segments` is expected to match the generator's
`num_segments` value.)

‍

###### Lesson Until Clause Syntax

```inkling--syntax
untilClause ::=
until
      [ minimize | maximize ] <objectiveFunctionName>
    |
      <objectiveFunctionName> relOp constantExpression

relOp ::=
  '==' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>='
```

Select the Syntax tab for the **until** clause syntax.

The **until** clause is only required if the curriculum _trainingSpecifier_ is **simulator**.  If this curriculum has a _trainingSpecifier_ of **data** or **generator**, the **until** clause is optional. If it is not present, a default with value minimize will be created.

‍
The **until** clause in the lesson specifies the termination condition for training. The **until** clause in our breakout example above was this:

  *until minimize ball_location_distance*

‍
This means train until the curriculum objective (`ball_location_distance`) is minimized.
