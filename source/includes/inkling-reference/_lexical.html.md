# Lexical Structure

Reference for the lexical structure of the Inkling language.

### What is it?

The lexical structure of Inkling includes these lexical elements:

* `comment`: specifies comment format.
* `keyword`: the keyword set consists of the words that Inkling reserves for its own use.
* `identifier`: user defined names in Inkling. For example, concept names.
* `literal`: Inkling supports numeric and string literals.
* `operator`: Inkling supports operators such as math operators and grouping operators.


## Comments

* An Inkling comment begins after the character **#** and extends to the end of the line.

```inkling--code
  # this is a comment
```

## Keywords

Here is the set of keywords in the Inkling language. These words are reserved
for use by Inkling and cannot be used as names in your program. 

**Keywords Table**

               |                |                |                |                |
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
action | and | as | Bool | Byte
concept | configure | constrain | copy | curriculum
data | datastore | debug | Double | easy
end | expect | false | feeds | Float32
Float64 | follows | format | from | generator
hard | import | in | input | Int16
Int32 | Int64 | Int8 | into | is
lesson | let | Luminance | maximize
medium | minimize | not | objective | or
output | predicts | schema | select | send
simulator | state |  stream | String | test
train | true | UInt16 | UInt32 | UInt64
UInt8 | unit | until | using | validate
where | with | yield

## Identifiers

An Inkling identifier (user defined name) must begin with an underscore or
letter, followed by any combination of alphanumeric characters and underscore.

## Literals

Inkling supports numeric literals (floating point and integer).

* **Integer Literals**

Integer literals are a string of digits with an optional sign and no decimal
point.

* **Floating Point Literals**

Floating point literals can be Float32 or Float64 (double). Select the Inkling
tab to see some floating point literals: 

```inkling--code
 12.0, .5        # Float32 floating point literal
 1e7, 9e0        # Float64 (double) floating point literal
 13.0f7, .3f+2   # Float32 floating point literal
```

## Operators

The operator category includes mathematical, relational, and logical operators as well as
paired grouping operators like `{` and `}`.
