This reference contains comprehensive specifications and usage for the Inkling language, Bonsaiâ€™s special purpose programming language for training AI.

Inkling is a declarative, statically-typed language that provides a layer of
abstraction between the Inkling programmer and the vast and dynamic set of AI
algorithms that require expertise in machine learning. Inkling allows you to
focus at a conceptual level on what you want the machine to learn. That is why this model of
programming is called machine teaching.

An Inkling file contains the [concepts][1] (what and how you want to teach the AI), and a set of
[types][2] (which describe the data) necessary to train your BRAIN.
Training your BRAIN will also require a [simulator][3]. Python simulators are
introduced in the [Quick Start][4].

### Purpose

The purpose of the Inkling Reference is to give you the level of detailed
specification you need to write valid Inkling code. 
The syntax for Inkling statements is available here. 
This document also contains
examples and explanation so that you can understand Inkling better. 

### Functionality

Use the Inkling Reference for quick lookups while coding and also for deep dives
into subjects like type equivalence and range expressions.
