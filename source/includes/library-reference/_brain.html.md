# Brain Class

Manages a BRAIN instance, talks with the server backend, and contains
information about the BRAIN state. In future versions will be used to upload
and download Inkling to and from the BRAIN on the server.

Requires a configuration and a BRAIN name. The BRAIN name can be set in
several places, and there is an order of what takes precedence over the other as follows:

Brain() >> --brain >> .brains >> .bonsai[profile] >> .bonsai[DEFAULT] >> env[BONSAI_TRAIN_BRAIN]

such that ">>" indicates a decreasing order of precedence. Note that failure to set
BRAIN name in at least one of these places will result in a friendly error.

## Brain(config, name)

```python
config = bonsai_ai.Config(sys.argv)
brain = bonsai_ai.Brain(config)
print(brain)
```

Creates a local object for interacting with an existing BRAIN on the server.

| Argument | Description |
| ---      | ---         |
| `config` | Object returned by previously created `bonsai_ai.Config`. |
| `name`   | BRAIN name as specified on the server. If name is empty, the BRAIN name in `config` is used instead. |

brain.update()
