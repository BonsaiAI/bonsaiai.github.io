# SDK Overview

The Bonsai SDK is made up of a command line interface for interacting with and controlling BRAINs, a library for connecting simulations to a brain for training or predictions, and examples of simulators connecting to BRAINs. Bonsai libraries known as `libbonsai` (C++) and `bonsai-ai` (Python) wrap the Bonsai API to simplify the process of building simulators in C++ and Python programming languages. `bonsai-ai` is compatible with Python 2.7+ on Windows 7/10, macOS, and Linux.

It is strongly suggested that you first follow our guide to [Install the CLI][1] so you can be sure to have any Python prerequisites already installed.

The C++ library is still in beta and currently only available on macOS.
