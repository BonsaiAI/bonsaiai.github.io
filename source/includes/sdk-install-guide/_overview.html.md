# SDK Overview

The Bonsai SDK is made up of a command line interface for interacting with and controlling BRAINs, a library for connecting simulations to a brain for traingina and preictiojns, and examples that display simulators connecting to BRAINs. Bonsai libraries known as `libbonsai` (C++) and `bonsai-ai` (Python) wrap the Bonsai API to simplify the process of building simulators in C++ and Python programming languages. These libraries are compatible with Python 3+ on Windows 7/10, macOS, and Linux.

This guide will walk you through any prerequisites you may need, and how to install the Bonsai SDK. It is strongly suggested that you first follow our guide to [Install the CLI][1] so you can be sure to have any Python prerequisites already installed.

The C++ library is still in beta and currently only available on macOS.
