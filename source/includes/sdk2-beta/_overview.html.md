# Examples Overview

<aside class="warning">
These are examples for a beta release of sdk2. If you have any issues please contact support or your sales representative.
</aside>

This page contains working examples of Inkling code in conjunction with python simulator files. All of these examples and the libraries that accompany them can be found on [BonsaiAI's GitHub page][1] and are also linked within each Example.

All of the **Python**, **OpenAI Gym**, and **EnergyPlus** examples can be trained in the cloud with Bonsai managed simulators. A full list of supported Docker containers for remotely managed simulators can be found in the [Project File Reference][3].

If you have any suggestions of examples you'd like to see us implement please [contact the support team][2].

### Custom Python Simulator Examples
* **SimPy Simulator**: A basic example of how to use SimPy to simulate a scenario. This one is an elevator dropping people off on 3 floors.

### OpenAI Gym Examples
* **Cart Pole**: A simple control problem where a cart must make a simple move to keep a pole balanced on top.
* **Mountain Car**: A simple control problem where a car must build up enough momentum to climb a hill.

### Real World Examples
* **HVAC with EnergyPlus**: An example of climate control machine teaching using EnergyPlus and BCVTB for simulation.
